Write a function that takes 2 vectors of sorted integers, and merges them into a third sorted vector which you can assume is initially empty.   
The  prototype should look like this:void merge(const vector<int>& V1, const vector<int>& V2, vector<int>& result);
  As an example, if the first two vectors contain [2,4,5,9,13,17] and [1,3,7,8] respectively, then the result vector should contain [1,2,3,4,5,7,8,9,13,17].
  Note: Do NOT use a sort function. Youâ€™ll not receive any credit for doing the problem thisway.
